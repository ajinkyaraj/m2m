Dear Guru Maharaj,
Please accept my humble obeisances. 
All glories to Srila Prabhupada. 

Om ajnana timirandhasya jnananjana shalakaya
chakshurunmilitam yena tasmai sri guruve namah||
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the that spiritual master who by torchlight of knowledge has opened my eyes and saved me from darkness of ignorance. 

Guru Maharaj,
It is my great fortune that i am able to write some words of  your glorification because your glories are sung by great devotees. Being completely dependent on Krsna, you have developed such wonderful qualities that your association extinguishes the fire of material existence. Prahlad maharaj says that Because of our own karma,  we have been suffering from this fire of material existence especially the  seperation from loved ones and fire of associating with people not wanted. Because of such duality we are constantly disturbed and depressed. But your association is so powerful that as soon as we come in your presence we completely forget our miserable condition. No amount of wealth opulennce influence or personal influence can help one overcome the lamentation arising from effects of material nature. 
Therefore simply by being a devotee of Krsna one can render highest benefit to all the people in the world. 

You have always kept Srila Prabhupada's mission as only aim of your life. At every stage you have utilized the opportunities to spread the message of Srila Prabhupada in so many ways, be it huge book distribution of Prabhupada books, constructing beautiful temples, distributing prasadam by ISKCON food for life or showcasing largest Bhagavad-Gita which was inaugarated by Prime Minister of India. You have engaged everyone in spreading the Krsna consciousness. This is the nature of pure devotee. He is broadminded. You are compassionate not only to practicing devotees but also to people in general who will get immense benefit by coming in touch with Krsna somehow or other. 

You have been especially merciful to me by giving me your personal audience. We are so touched by your concern and love for us. Although you were super busy you took out time to provide your able guidance. Your heart filled with gratitude and you dont forget slightest service rendered by your devotees. The same principle you wanted us to embibe when you told us to be grateful to devotees who have given Krsna consciousness to us. I am very ungrateful and dont remember what good others do for me. I feel totally disqualified to call myself a devotee or even a human being.
