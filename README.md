All glories to Srila Prabhupada. 

Om ajnana timirandhasya jnananjana shalakaya
chakshurunmilitam yena tasmai sri guruve namah||
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the that spiritual master who by torchlight of knowledge has opened my eyes and saved me from darkness of ignorance. 

Guru Maharaj,
It is my great fortune that i am able to write some words of  your glorification because your glories are sung by great devotees. Being completely dependent on Krsna, you have developed such wonderful qualities that your association extinguishes the fire of material existence. Prahlad maharaj says that Because of our own karma,  we have been suffering from this fire of material existence especially the  seperation from loved ones and fire of associating with people not wanted. Because of such duality we are constantly disturbed and depressed. But your association is so powerful that as soon as we come in your presence we completely forget our miserable condition. No amount of wealth opulennce influence or personal influence can help one overcome the lamentation arising from effects of material nature. Therefore simply by being a devotee of Krsna one can render highest benefit to all the people in the world. 

You have always kept Srila Prabhupada's mission as only aim of your life. At every stage you have utilized the opportunities to spread the message of Srila Prabhupada in so many ways, be it huge book distribution of Prabhupada books, constructing beautiful temples, distributing prasadam by ISKCON food for life or showcasing largest Bhagavad-Gita which was inaugarated by Prime Minister of India. You have engaged everyone in spreading the Krsna consciousness. This is the nature of pure devotee. He is broadminded. You are compassionate not only to practicing devotees but also to people in general who will get immense benefit by coming in touch with Krsna somehow or other. 

You have been especially merciful to me by giving me your personal audience. We are so touched by your concern and love for us. How you asked about even simple things of our life, told us to come to temple regularly. "Chant, read and preach" this is what your words were when we asked for some service. In one of your lectures you said that " Guru does not expect that you will do some miracles, If you just simply follow the program given by previous acharyas, Guru becomes pleased". Although you were super busy you took out time to provide your able guidance. Your heart filled with gratitude and you dont forget slightest service rendered by your devotees. The same principle you wanted us to embibe when you told us to be grateful to devotees who have given Krsna consciousness to us. My wife also is very grateful for the service she is able to render your Holiness. She always tells me how your classes are so powerful and you speak about Krsna consciousness without any reservation or compromise. 

Your heart is filled with appreciation for other devotees. This i got to experience when i heard one class of yours, your speech at opening of the Rajakot temple. You glorified the efforts of all the devotees so heartily and offered them so many blessings. Despite so many difficulties you were so determined to participate in every function of temple opening. The devotees felt immensely happy by your constant support although they were not your direct disciples. Seeing your magnanimous heart i felt immensly happy. By association with krishna , the living entity exhibits all godly qualities.  Whereas by association with matter we display horrible qualities like fear, anger, hatred for others.

Simply by writing glorification of Krsna's pure devotee, I  feel I am relived from unlimited suffering. This gives me determination to  keep on singing your glories and give up all the material desires, fear and miserliness which has hampered my devotional service from such a long time. I have increased my participation in activities of temple and have started to participate in preaching programs. Seeing sincere devotees who are serious about practising Krsna consciousness in almost every part of the world, I am simply amazed and I pray at lotus feet of Your divine grace that I remain grateful to what you have given us and try to please you by rendering devotional service. 

Your humble servant
